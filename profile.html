        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I have worked in Winter Springs at Stefano's Trattoria for 11 years now and will miss doing it immensely.</p>
        <p>Even though I have never formally trained in any other field besides in the military, I believe that my experiences in life and my extreme work ethic will go a long way in my web development studies as well.</p>
      </div> 

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>I have a family that I love and care for and a son with autism who's mom is busy at work becoming his homeschooling teacher. It is up to me to develop (no pun intended) into someone who can provide in a different way than I am used to. I'm lookin forward to continuing in this challenging endeavor.</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to work for a web design firm helping clients create an impressive online presence.</p>
          <p>The background-image I used is, unfortunately, not indicitive of where I live. It only portrays what I wish it looked like. I am excited to grow in development, so as to have the option of going somewhere like this whenever I please.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I used to watch and play basketball. I enjoy reading my bible and other literature. There are a few things I am working on while we figure out how life is sopposed to be moving forward:</p>
        <ul class="hobbies">
          <li>Nutrition</li>
          <li>Fitness</li>
          <li>Spiritual Health</li>
          <li>Learning a new skill</li>
          <li>Gaining employment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to work at something that I truly enjoy. I have never found that before and necer would have if God didn't open this window of opportunity. He knows what he is doing.</p>
