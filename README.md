# first-project
I have had so much trouble understanding how to get to this point but I am NOT giving up. 
I finally have the right files in a repo for my first project with teamTreehouse.
I hope that this is how I am supposed to do this. If not, I'm no stranger to set-backs.
I know this is the path I am on for a reason. I will help the next struggling developer when they are starting out.
Happy to say I bought a desktop and am up and running. Thanks to Treehouse support.
